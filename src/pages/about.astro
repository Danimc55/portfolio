			Hello! My name is Danijel. I am a 18 year old Developer/Entropenuer from
			Slovenia. I started my development path at the age of 12. With Python,
			HTML & CSS. I also dabble in some graphic design.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am still studying computer science. I'm in my 4th year of Computer
			Science secondary school. In school we worked with a variety of tools such
			as:
		</p>
		<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
			<li>Python + Libraries(Pygame, Tensorflow, OpenCV)</li>
			<li>Java & Kotlin</li>
			<li>Php (Sadly)</li>
			<li>Sql</li>
			<li>Adobe CC</li>
			<li>GNU Linux</li>
			<li>C for Embedded</li>
		</ul>

			Recently in March of 2022 i have Co-founded our startup Å krinca. Our
			product is The Wafer. What is it? It is a Multitool in the shape of a
			Neapolitan wafer. It features a Bluetooth tracker, USB flash drive,
			screwdriver, file, bottle opener. What does it look like? I'll show you
			our very first prototype.
